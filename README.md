## üìñ Introduction

This repository provides a Flask web application for classifying Iris flowers. The app leverages a trained machine learning model to predict the species of an Iris flower based on user input for sepal and petal dimensions. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding how to deploy machine learning models using Flask.
